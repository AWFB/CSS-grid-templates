        <h2>Nominations open for Chair and Secretary</h2>
        <img src="img/vote.jpg" alt="vote" />
        <p>
          The next Stakeholder meeting will take place via Teams on Friday 3rd
          December, 1.30 - 4.00 pm. Please let me know if you plan to attend the
          meeting or if you are unable to do so. 
          
          <p> As previously discussed, the
          MetBioNet Secretary and Chair come to the end of their terms of office
          in March 2022. We would like to appoint the new post holders at the
          next Stakeholder meeting so that they are ready to take up their posts
          in March.</p> 
          <p>Attached are the job descriptions for both posts and a
          nomination form. If you are willing to serve in one of these posts,
          please ask a colleague from a Stakeholder laboratory (it can be your
          own lab) to nominate you. If you would like more information either
          post, please contact myself to discuss.</p> 
          <p>Please also consider if there is anyone you think would be suitable
          for the posts and discuss with them whether they would like to be
          nominated. Please send nominations to me by 5pm on Friday 26th
          November. If there is more than one nomination for a post, we will
          have an election. Each department will have one vote and I hope to be
          able to organise this in time for the meeting the following Friday.</p>
